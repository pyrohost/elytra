Elytra is a maintained fork of [Pterodactyl Wings](https://github.com/pterodactyl/wings), developed and supported by [Pyro Inc.](https://pyro.host).

We created Elytra after identifying **ongoing stability concerns, missing functionality, and slower development in the upstream Wings project**. While we still track and merge relevant changes from upstream, Elytra follows its own development path with new features, performance improvements, and integrations designed specifically for the [Pyrodactyl Panel](https://github.com/pyrohost/panel).

Over time, **Elytra will move further away from Wings**, with some features becoming exclusive to Pyrodactyl. **Pyrodactyl is expected to adopt Elytra as its primary and possibly only supported Wings implementation**. This approach allows us to provide a unified and integrated hosting stack with better stability, security, and maintainability.
